AuthN
-----

authn is a simplistic and barebones authentication library.
It only does a few things for you, such as:

  * Give you a controller and helper method to access the "current user"
  * Give you simple "sign in", "sign out", and "auto sign in" methods
  * Works with any ORM that behaves likes ActiveModel
  * Functions with any framework that has a session interface

In addition you can bring in other behavior sets like:

  * authn-activation: Account activation
  * authn-protection: Failed login protection
  * authn-recovery: Password recovery
  * rails-authn: Extend Rails with AuthN

Using AuthN
===========

To start using authn you simply need to install and hook up to your existing "user" model:

``` ruby
# create_table :accounts do |t|
#   t.string :email
#   t.binary :password_digest
#
#   t.timestamps
# end
# add_index :accounts, :email
#

class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AuthN::Model

  has_authentication
  has_secure_password

  validates :email, uniqueness: true, presence: true, length: 5..255
  validates :password, length: 10..1024

  attr_accessible :email
end
```

See?
No muss, no fuss.
Now what about all those addons?
We'll you can see their own pages, but here's a taste:

``` ruby
# create_table :accounts do |t|
#   t.string :email
#   t.binary :password_digest
#
#   t.string :activation_token
#   t.boolean :activation_state, default: false
#   t.datetime :activation_expires_at
#
#   t.string :password_recovery_token
#   t.datetime :password_recovery_expires_at
#
#   t.string :login_protection_token
#   t.datetime :login_protection_expires_at
#   t.integer :login_protection_attempts, default: 0
#
#   t.timestamps
# end
# add_index :accounts, :email
# add_index :accounts, :activation_token
# add_index :accounts, :activation_state
# add_index :accounts, :password_recovery_token
# add_index :accounts, :login_protection_token
#

class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AuthN::Model

  has_authentication
  has_password_recovery mailer: "PasswordRecoveryMailer"
  has_activation mailer: "ActivationMailer", on_create: false
  has_login_protection maximum: 3, redirect: { controller: :accounts, action: :maximum_login_failure }
  has_secure_password

  validates :email, uniqueness: true, presence: true, length: 5..255
  validates :password, length: 10..1024

  attr_accessible :email
end
```

You'll notice that there are options after some of the addon singleton methods.
These are used to overwrite the global configuration.
authn assumes quite a few things, but never stops you from changing how it works.
As above you can change how each of your "user" models functions (for say admin recovery emails vs support recovery emails).
In addition you can either programatically write the "global" configuration or have a `authn.yml` file ready to be loaded.

Installing AuthN
================

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'authn'
